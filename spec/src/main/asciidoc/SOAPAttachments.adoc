Terminology

The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL,
SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they
appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
as quoted here:

MUST: This word, or the terms “REQUIRED” or
“SHALL”, mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the
specification.

MUST NOT: This phrase, or the phrase “SHALL
NOT”, mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the
specification.

SHOULD: This word, or the adjective
“RECOMMENDED”, mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular
circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications
must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different
course.

SHOULD NOT: This phrase, or the phrase “NOT
RECOMMENDED”, mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular
circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful,
but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully
weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.

MAY: This word, or the adjective “OPTIONAL”,
mean that an item is truly optional. One vendor may choose to include
the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the
vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit
the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular
option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation
which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced
functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a
particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another
implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for
the feature the option provides.

Audience

This document is intended for developers using
the Java™ programming language who wish to produce and consume messages
conforming to the SOAP 1.1, and SOAP 1.2 specification and the SOAP
Attachments Feature.

Familiarity with the SOAP specifications
(including the associated processing model), MIME standards, and XML is
assumed.

Abstract

Jakarta SOAP with Attachments defines an API enabling developers to produce 
and consume messages conforming to the SOAP 1.1, SOAP 1.2 and SOAP Attachments Feature.

In the interest of backward compatibility, SAAJ
continues to offer a client-side communication capability enabling
developers to communicate in a point-to-point and request-response
manner with SOAP services bound to HTTP. This communication capability,
within the context of the SAAJ specification, is optional. However,
specifications depending on SAAJ are free to require support for the
SOAP to HTTP binding.

Change History

=== Changes in Maintenance Release 4

The fourth maintenance release of SAAJ, SAAJ
1.4, clarifies and extends the SAAJ 1.3 specification.The goal of this
maintenance release proposal is primarily to adopt changes in Java SE
Platform and to make a few corrections and clarifications on the
existing SAAJ 1.3 APIs. The proposed API changes in SAAJ 1.4 are
backward compatible with SAAJ 1.3 APIs.

The “accepted changes,” as specified in JSR067
changelog, have been incorporated in this document. The key changes are
as follows:

Changed the definition of the discovery process
of SAAJ implementation.

Added support for generics where applicable.

Changed MAY to MUST in
jakarta.xml.soap.SOAPElements methods.

Several corrections and clarifications have been
made to the JavaDocs for the API.

=== Changes in Maintenance Release 3

The third maintenance release of SAAJ, SAAJ 1.3,
clarifies and extends the SAAJ 1.2 specification.The goal of this
maintenance release proposal is primarily to provide support for SOAP
version 1.2 Message Constructs and to make a few corrections and
clarifications on the existing SAAJ 1.2 APIs. The proposed API changes
in SAAJ 1.3 are backward compatible with SAAJ 1.2 APIs.

SOAP version 1.2 has a number of changes in
syntax and provides additional (or clarified) semantics from those
described in SOAP 1.1. This proposed changes in this maintenance release
are concerned with the following areas:

Support for SOAP version 1.2 message constructs
in the API.

Factoring out the creation of all SAAJ Factory
classes into a single SPI that allows creation of SOAP version aware
Factories.

Addition of a few new classes and new methods in
certain existing classes and interfaces.

Support for overloaded QName based methods in
certain classes and interfaces.

Clarification of semantics and correction of
wording of JavaDocs and specification

A brief summary of the proposed changes follows:

Support for SOAP Version 1.2 message constructs
in the API: SOAP Version 1.2 has a number of changes in syntax and
introduces several new Message Constructs. SAAJ 1.3 will support SOAP
Version 1.2 Message Constructs.

SPI for Creation of Factory Instances: SAAJ 1.3
will support SOAP Version 1.2 Message Constructs, while at the same time
being backward compatible in its support for SOAP Version 1.1. We would
like to define an SPI (SAAJMetaFactory) for factoring out the creation
of SOAP Version aware Factory classes into a single place. Changing out
the SAAJMetaFactory has the effect of changing out the entire SAAJ
implementation. Backward compatibility is maintained by ensuring that
the default protocol is set to SOAP Version 1.1.

Definition of new Class SAAJResult: A SAAJResult
object acts as a holder for the results of a JAXP transformation or a
JAXB marshalling, in the form of a SAAJ tree. This class will make it
easier for the end user when dealing with transformations in situations
where the result is expected to be a valid SAAJ tree.

Addition of overloaded methods which accept a
QName instead of a Name: QName is the preferred representation of XML
qualified names, and hence we would like to introduce overloaded methods
in all APIs where a corresponding method was accepting a
jakarta.xml.soap.Name as argument. The Name interface may be deprecated in
a future release of SAAJ in favor of QName.

Clarify and correct the wording of JavaDocs and
specification: None of these changes will break backward compatibility
for SOAP 1.1 users. Corrections of this nature cost little and improve
the overall integrity of the specification making correct
implementations easier to create, validate and use.

Addition of new methods in certain Interfaces
and Classes: A few new methods have been introduced in AttachmentPart,
SOAPBody, and SOAPElement. These new methods are intended for ease of
use and to assist SAAJ users when dealing with some of the newer SOAP
features.

Making SOAPPart a jakarta.xml.soap.Node: The
SOAPPart is also a SOAP Node.

Deferred Changes: The deprecation of Name
Interface has been deferred to a later release.

DOM Level 3 Support: Implementations of SAAJ 1.3
must provide support for DOM Level 3 APIs.

=== Changes in Maintenance Release 2

The second maintenance release of SAAJ, SAAJ
1.2, clarifies and extends the SAAJ 1.1 specification. The “accepted
changes”, as specified in the Change Log forSOAP with Attachments API
for Java™, have been incorporated into this document. A summary of the
changes follows:

The core SAAJ classes and interfaces: _Node_ ,
_SOAPElement_ , _SOAPPart_ , and _Text_ now extend the equivalent
interfaces in the _org.w3c.dom_ package: _Node_ , _Element_ , Document
and _Text_ respectively.

The ability to get and set properties on
_SOAPMessage_ has been added to _SOAPMessage_ in order to facilitate
extensibility and two new properties have been added in order to take
advantage of this extensibility: _CHARACTER_SET_ENCODING_ allows the
character encoding to be set to “utf-8” or“utf-16” where “utf-8” is the
default. Implementations may optionally support other character
encodings. _WRITE_XML_DECLARATION_ allows clients to specify whether or
not an XML Declaration will be written at the start of the SOAP part of
the message. The valid values are “true” and “false” with “false” being
the default.

Several APIs have been extended in order to
provide greater ease of use. The _Node_ interface has gained a
_setValue_ () method. _SOAPFault_ has been enhanced with several methods
that facilitate the handling of its sub-elements. _SOAPMessage_ ,
_SOAPElement_ , _SOAPBody_ and _SOAPHeader_ have all been given new
methods that enhance navigation of the tree. A removeContents() element
has been added to _SOAPElement_ in order to assist in the construction
of messages that contain a fault.

Several corrections and clarifications have been
made to the JavaDocs for the API.

This specification has been derived from the
_jakarta.XML.SOAP_ package originally defined in the JAXM 1.0
specification. The “accepted changes,” as specified in JSR067 changelog,
have been incorporated in this document. The key changes are as follows:

 _jakarta.xml.soap_ package was moved from the
JAXM specification to this document. In the interest of consistency and
for simplifying synchronization of specifications, this document has
been designated as version 1.1 of the SAAJ specification. There are no
prior versions of the SAAJ specification.

The _call_ method signature of the
_SOAPConnection_ object has been modified so as to remove the dependency
of SAAJ on JAXM.

The _newInstance_ method of
_SOAPConnectionFactory_ may throw an _UnsupportedOperationException_
hence making the implementation of the _SOAPConnection.call()_
functionality optional.

The _SOAPElementFactory_ has been deprecated and
a new “super” factory for creating _Element_ , _Detail_ , and _Name_
objects created. The previous _SOAPElementFactory_ methods now delegate
to the appropriate _SOAPFactory_ methods.

Package Overview

image:soapatt-10.png[image]

This chapter presents an overview of the SAAJ
which consists of the single package; _jakarta.xml.soap_ . The intent here
is to provide an overview of the package only, the details of which can
be found in the following chapter.

The _jakarta.xml.soap_ package provides the
primary abstraction for SOAP Messages with MIME attachments. Attachments
may be entire XML documents, XML fragments, images, text documents, or
any other content with a valid MIME type. In addition, this package
provides a simple client-side view of a request-response style of
interaction with a SOAP service.

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

MessageFactory & SOAPMessage Objects

The _MessageFactory_ class is used to create
_SOAPMessage_ objects. Clients may create SOAPMessage objects by calling
the _MessageFactory.createMessage_ method.

The _SOAPMessage_ class is the root class for
all SOAP messages. Such messages must contain a single _SOAPPart_ object
and may contain one or more _AttachmentPart_ objects. The “on-the-wire”
encoding of a SOAP message is governed by whether the _SOAPMessage_
object includes _AttachmentPart_ objects. If it does, the _SOAPMessage_
object is encoded as a MIME message otherwise it is encoded as a simple
XML message. Attachments may contain data of any type including XML. The
SOAPPart is always XML.

SAAJ allows for creation and consumption of
both SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 messages by introducing the notion of
Protocol aware MessageFactories. The protocol here refers to a
particular version of SOAP. For example a SOAP 1.2 aware MessageFactory
can be obtained by calling the MessageFactory.newInstance method and
passing it the appropriate protocol identifier. The allowed protocol
identifiers have been defined in SOAPConstants. For processing incoming
messages a special protocol identifier called DYNAMIC_SOAP_PROTOCOL can
be used to allow a Node to accept both SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 messages.



=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

SOAPPart & AttachmentPart

The _SOAPPart_ object is a MIME part
containing the _SOAPEnvelope_ object. The _SOAPEnvelope_ object must
contain a single _SOAPBody_ object and may contain a _SOAPHeader_
object.

A _SOAPMessage_ object may contain zero or
more _AttachmentPart_ objects. Each _AttachmentPart_ object in turn
contains application-specific content and corresponding MIME headers.
The MIME headers consist of name/value pairs that are used to identify
and describe the content. For MIME content-types of _text/plain_ ,
_text/html_ and _text/xml_ , the _DataContentHandler_ object performs
the necessary conversions to and from the Java types corresponding to
the MIME types. Other MIME types can be supported by passing an
_InputStream_ object (that contains the content data) to the
_AttachmentPart.setContent_ method. Similarly, the contents and header
from an _AttachmentPart_ object can be retrieved using the _getContent_
method. Depending on the _AttachmentPart_ objects present, the returned
_Object_ can be either a typed Java object corresponding to the MIME
type or an _InputStream_ object that contains the content as bytes. The
_clearContent_ method is a helper method intended to facilitate the
removal of all the content from an _AttachmentPart_ object while leaving
the header information.

A SAAJ 2.0 implementation must support the
following MIME types. Additional MIME types may be supported using the
_jakarta.activation.DataHandler_ class and the Java™ Activation Framework.

=== SAAJ 2.0’s supported MIME types

=== MIME Type

=== Java Type

 _text/plain_

 _java.lang.String_

 _multipart/*_

 _jakarta.mail.internet.MimeMultipart_

 _text/xml_ or _application/xml_

 _jakarta.xml.transform.Source_

SAAJ provides methods for setting and getting
the Raw content of an Attachment. Methods have also been provided to get
the content as Base64 encoded character data. Additionally a
getAttachment method on the SOAPMessage provides for retrieval of an
Attachment referenced from a SOAPElement using an href attribute as
described in SOAP Messages with Attachments, or via a single Text child
node containing a URI as described in the WS-I Attachments Profile 1.0
for elements of schema type ref:swaRef

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

MimeHeader(s) Objects

The _MIMEHeaders_ class is a container for
_MimeHeader_ objects and serves as an abstraction for the MIME headers
that must be present if an _AttachmentPart_ object exists in a
_SOAPMessage_ object.

The _MimeHeader_ object is the abstraction for
a name/value pair of a MIME header. A _MimeHeaders_ object may contain
one or more _MimeHeader_ objects.

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

SOAP Element

The _SOAPElement_ object is the base class for
all of the classes that model the SOAP objects defined by the SOAP1.1
and SOAP 1.2 specifications. A _SOAPElement_ object may be used to model
the following:

content in a _SOAPBody_ object

content in a _SOAPHeader_ object

content that can follow the _SOAPBody_ object
within a _SOAPEnvelope_ object

whatever may follow the detail element in a
_SOAPFault_ object

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

SOAPEnvelope & SOAPBody objects

The _SOAPEnvelope_ object is a container
object for the _SOAPHeader_ and _SOAPBody_ portions of a _SOAPPart_
object. The _SOAPEnvelope_ object must contain a _SOAPBody_ object, but
the _SOAPHeader_ object is optional.

The _SOAPEnvelope_ and _SOAPBody_ objects both
extend the _SOAPElement_ object. The _SOAPBody_ object models the
contents of the SOAP body element in a SOAP message. A SOAP body element
contains XML data that may determine how application-specific content
must be processed.

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

SOAPBodyElement & SOAPFault

 _SOAPBody_ objects contain _SOAPBodyElement_
objects that model the content of the SOAP body. An example of a
_SOAPBodyElement_ is the _SOAPFault_ object.

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

SOAPFaultElement & Detail

The _SOAPFaultElement_ is used to represent
the contents of a _SOAPFault_ object.

The _Detail_ interface is a container for
_DetailEntry_ objects that provide application-specific error
information associated with the _SOAPBody_ object that contains it.

A _Detail_ object is part of a _SOAPFault_
object and may be retrieved using the _getDetail_ method of the
_SOAPFault_ object.

The _DetailEntry_ object extends _SOAPElement_
and models the contents of a _Detail_ object.

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

SOAPHeader & SOAPHeaderElement

A _SOAPHeader_ object is an abstraction of the
SOAP header element. A _SOAPHeader_ object can be created using the
_SOAPEnvelope.addHeader_ method. _SOAPHeader_ objects can have only
_SOAPHeaderElement_ objects as their immediate children. The
_addHeaderElement_ method creates a new _HeaderElement_ object and adds
it to the _SOAPHeader_ object.

 _SOAPHeader_ and _SOAPHeaderElement_ objects
both extend the _SOAPElement_ object. A _SOAPHeaderElement_ object
models the contents of the SOAP header of a SOAP envelope.

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

SOAPConnection & SOAPConnectionFactory

The _SOAPConnection_ object represents a
simple client-side view of a request-response style of SOAP messaging. A
SAAJ client may choose to establish a synchronous point-to-point
connection to a SOAP service using the _createConnection_ method of the
_SOAPConnectionFactory_ object. Subsequently, a _SOAPMessage_ may be
sent to a remote party using the call method on the _SOAPConnection_
object. Note that the call method will block until a _SOAPMessage_
object is received.

A SAAJ based application may choose to use the
call method to implement the client side of a simple point-to-point
synchronous one-way message exchange scenario. In such a case, it is the
application’s responsibility to ignore the _SOAPMessage_ object returned
by the call method because the _SOAPMessage_ object’s only purpose is to
unblock the client. It is assumed that a one-way service will not return
a response to a request using the same connection when the
_SOAPConnection.call_ method was used to send the request.

SAAJ also provides support for the SOAP 1.2
Response Message Exchange Pattern
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part2-20030624/#soapresmep) via
the SOAPConnection.get method. This method can be used for pure
information retrieval, where the representation of an available
resource, identified by a URI, is fetched using a HTTP GET request
without affecting the resource in any way

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

SOAPException object

The _SOAPException_ object extends
_java.lang.Exception_ and is used to signal SOAP level exceptions.

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

Node & Text objects

The _Node_ object models a node (element) of a
DOM abstraction of an XML document.

The _Text_ object extends _Node_ and
represents a node whose value is text. A _Text_ object may model either
text that is content or text that is a comment.

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

Name

The _Name_ object models an XML name. This
interface provides methods for getting the local names,
namespace-qualified names, the prefix associated with the namespace for
the name, and the URI of the namespace.

Name objects are created using the
_SOAPEnvelope.createName_ method.

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

SOAPFactory & SOAPElementFactory

These factories are intended primarily for
the use of application components or tools that require the capability
of inserting XML fragments into a SOAP Message. In SAAJ v1.1, the
_SOAPElementFactory_ has been deprecated in favor of _SOAPFactory_ which
serves as a super factory for the creation of _SOAPElement_ , _Name_ ,
and _Detail_ objects.

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

SAAJMetaFactory

This Factory is the access point for the
implementation classes of all the other factories defined in the SAAJ
API. All of the newInstance methods defined on factories in SAAJ defer
to instances of this class to do the actual object creation. The
implementations of newInstance() methods (in SOAPFactory and
MessageFactory) that existed in SAAJ 1.2 have been updated to also
delegate to the SAAJMetaFactory when the SAAJ 1.2 defined lookup fails
to locate the Factory implementation class name.

SAAJMetaFactory is a service provider
interface. There are no public methods on this class.

=== 

image:soapatt-11.png[image]

SAAJResult

This concrete class acts as a holder for the
results of a JAXP transformation or a JAXB marshalling, in the form of a
SAAJ tree. This class will make it easier for the end user when dealing
with transformations in situations where the result is expected to be a
valid SAAJ tree. The results can be accessed by using the getResult
method.

Package: jakarta.xml.soap

image:soapatt-13.png[image]

=== 

image:soapatt-14.png[image]

Description

Provides the API for creating and building SOAP
messages. This package is defined in the _SOAP with Attachments API for
Java_ _TM_ _(SAAJ) 2.0_ specification.

The API in the _jakarta.xml.soap_ package allows
you to do the following:

create a point-to-point connection to a
specified endpoint

create a SOAP message

create an XML fragment

add content to the header of a SOAP message

add content to the body of a SOAP message

create attachment parts and add content to them

access/add/modify parts of a SOAP message

create/add/modify SOAP fault information

extract content from a SOAP message

send a SOAP request-response message

In addition the APIs in the _jakarta.xml.soap_
package extend their counterparts in the _org.w3c.dom_ package. This
means that the _SOAPPart_ of a _SOAPMessage_ is also a DOM Level 2
_Document_ , and can be manipulated as such by applications, tools and
libraries that use DOM (see http://www.w3.org/DOM/ for more
information). It is important to note that, while it is possible to use
DOM APIs to add ordinary DOM nodes to a SAAJ tree, the SAAJ APIs are
still required to return SAAJ types when examining or manipulating the
tree. In order to accomplish this the SAAJ APIs (specifically
_link:saaj.html#UNKNOWN[SOAPElement.getChildElements()]link:saaj.html#50601996_MemberHead[See
getChildElements()] ) are allowed to silently replace objects that are
incorrectly typed relative to SAAJ requirements with equivalent objects
of the required type. These replacements must never cause the logical
structure of the tree to change, so from the perspective of the DOM APIs
the tree will remain unchanged. However, the physical composition of the
tree will have changed so that references to the nodes that were
replaced will refer to nodes that are no longer a part of the tree. The
SAAJ APIs are not allowed to make these replacements if they are not
required so the replacement objects will never subsequently be silently
replaced by future calls to the SAAJ API._

What this means in practical terms is that an
application that starts to use SAAJ APIs on a tree after manipulating it
using DOM APIs must assume that the tree has been translated into an all
SAAJ tree and that any references to objects within the tree that were
obtained using DOM APIs are no longer valid. Switching from SAAJ APIs to
DOM APIs is not allowed to cause invalid references and neither is using
SAAJ APIs exclusively. It is only switching from using DOM APIs on a
particular SAAJ tree to using SAAJ APIs that causes the risk of invalid
references.

=== Discovery of SAAJ implementation

There are several factories defined in the
SAAJ API to discover and load specific implementation:

SOAPFactory

MessageFactory

SOAPConnectionFactory

SAAJMetaFactory

First three define newInstance() method which
uses a common lookup procedure to determine the implementation class:

Checks if a system property with the same
name as the factory class is set (e.g. jakarta.xml.soap.SOAPFactory). If
such property exists then its value is assumed to be the fully qualified
name of the implementation class. This phase of the look up enables
per-JVM override of the SAAJ implementation.

Use the configuration file "jaxm.properties".
The file is in standard Properties format and typically located in the
conf directory of the Java installation. It contains the fully qualified
name of the implementation class with the key being the system property
defined above.

Use the service-provider loading facilities,
defined by the ServiceLoader class, to attempt to locate and load an
implementation of the service using the default loading mechanism.

Finally, if all the steps above fail,
SAAJMetaFactory instance is used to locate specific implementation (for
MessageFactory and SOAPFactory) or platform default implementation is
used (SOAPConnectionFactory). Whenever SAAJMetaFactory is used, its
lookup procedure to get actual instance is performed. +
